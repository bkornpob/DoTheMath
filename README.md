# DoTheMath

DoTheMath challenges your mathematical skill in 2D-side-scroll mode.

This is apart of Spring 2017 project at OUGDA under the theme "flash game."

Project is still under development.
Note: resolution 800x600 shows no problem, but 1920x1080 has an issue with the equation at the bottom of the screen.

DoTheMath.unitypackage was built with Unity 5.4.

DoTheMath_Mac.zip is for MacOS.

DoTheMath_Windows.zip is for Windows.
